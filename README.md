# üåç CarbonImpact: Decentralized Carbon Footprint Platform

Welcome to CarbonImpact, a cutting-edge Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project tackles climate change by empowering individuals to monitor, manage, and offset their carbon footprints with transparency and accountability. Users can log daily activities to calculate emissions, offset them through tokenized investments in verified renewable energy projects, and participate in a community-driven rewards system to promote sustainable living.

CarbonImpact improves upon traditional carbon offset systems by ensuring immutable, fraud-proof records of emissions and offsets, while offering tokenized stakes in real-world renewable projects like solar, wind, or reforestation initiatives. With gamified incentives and decentralized governance, CarbonImpact empowers users to make a measurable environmental impact while fostering a global community of eco-conscious individuals.

## ‚ú® Features

üìà **Track Emissions**: Log daily activities (e.g., transportation, energy consumption, food choices) to calculate your carbon footprint in real-time.  
üå± **Offset with Confidence**: Purchase and redeem tokenized renewable energy credits, directly linked to verified green projects.  
üèÜ **Earn Rewards**: Stake tokens to earn rewards for maintaining a low-carbon lifestyle or participating in governance decisions.  
üîç **Transparent Verification**: Verify the authenticity of offsets and project impacts via blockchain records.  
ü§ù **Community Governance**: Vote on new renewable projects to fund using platform tokens.  
üîê **Immutable Records**: Ensure all carbon data and transactions are securely stored on the blockchain.  
üåê **Global Impact**: Connect with a worldwide community to share sustainability tips and track collective progress.

## üõ† How It Works

**For Users**  
- Log daily activities (e.g., miles driven, meals eaten) to calculate your carbon footprint using the `carbon-tracker` contract.  
- Purchase tokenized renewable credits via the `offset-marketplace` contract, tied to real-world green projects.  
- Redeem credits to offset emissions using the `offset-redeemer` contract, with immutable proof of impact.  
- Stake platform tokens in the `reward-staker` contract to earn incentives for sustainable habits.  
- Vote on new renewable projects using the `governance-voting` contract to shape the platform‚Äôs impact.  

**For Verifiers**  
- Use the `project-verifier` contract to check the legitimacy of renewable projects and their tokenized credits.  
- Access user carbon data and offset history via the `carbon-ledger` contract for transparency.  

**For Project Owners**  
- Register renewable projects (e.g., solar farms, wind turbines) via the `project-registry` contract to receive funding.  
- Issue tokenized credits backed by real-world impact through the `token-issuer` contract.
